This notebook contains the age and transit time distributions for the ecosystem model obtained for the tropical forests of the Porce region in Colombia used in Mu√±oz et al. 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16961). This model was developed by  Sierra et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13723). This notebook uses the Python package LAMP developed by Metzler and Sierra (2018) (https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/LAPM).
